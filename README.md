# iDAI.world core

iDAI.world core is the basic datamodel used to aggregate information on the
data in the several heterogenous applications of the iDAI.world.

It is defined as an OWL ontology that can be edited using Protégé.

This repository also contains *examples* for the application of this ontology
as JSON files.

The folder *contexts* contains JSON-LD context definitions that can be used
to generate linked data in different flavours.
